# Reflect Forge

Reflect Forge is a local-first agentic coding and automation environment designed
to turn intent into execution.

Built as a standalone system, Reflect Forge combines a lightweight script editor
with local AI agents capable of coding, scripting, research, automation, and
general agentic tasks—without requiring cloud dependency or proprietary services.

## Origins

The ideas behind Reflect Forge trace back to work I began in 2023, focused on
making complex systems more accessible through structure, tooling, and practical
interfaces. This project represents the modern evolution of that thinking,
enabled by recent advances in local AI and agentic frameworks.

## Core Ideas

- Local-first execution on consumer-grade hardware
- Agentic systems built through structure, not model size
- Transparent behavior, instruction, and orchestration
- Code and non-code agent workflows in a single environment
- Control, ownership, and adaptability over convenience

## What Reflect Forge Is

- A forked, script-based editor inspired by tools like VS Code and Atom
- An environment where local AI agents assist with:
  - Coding and refactoring
  - Scripting and automation
  - Research, scraping, and summarization
  - Task orchestration and execution

## What Reflect Forge Is Not

- A cloud-hosted IDE
- A proprietary AI service
- A model-specific or vendor-locked tool

## Current Status

This repository is an early-stage architectural and conceptual shell.
Implementation will evolve iteratively as experimentation continues.

## Open Source and Adoption

Reflect Forge is released as open source to encourage exploration, iteration,
and community learning.

Future iterations are intended to support adoption across:
- Personal projects
- Small businesses
- Educational environments
- Public and institutional use

Commercial customization, deployment, and support models are planned alongside
open-source development.

## Philosophy

The agent is only as capable as the system around it.
Structure creates capability.
Capability creates confidence.
